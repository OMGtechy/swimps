# Preamble.

So you're thinking of contributing? Wonderful! This document covers a few things to make sure we don't get into a legal mess in the future, as well as ideas for where to start.

# Where to start?

## Code.

Take a look at the [issues page](https://github.com/OMGtechy/swimps/issues) for ideas. You're welcome to just ask the project owner too. Fixing compiler warnings that were somehow missed is also generally well-received. Once your changes are made, make a pull request and hopefully it'll get intergrated.

## Finding bugs.

Found a problem? Pop onto the [issues page](https://github.com/OMGtechy/swimps/issues) and let it be known! Make sure you say what you were doing, how you were trying to achieve it, what happened, how often it reproduces, what you expected to happen and what actually happened.

## Suggestions.

Have an idea for how it could be better? Writing it up on the [issues page](https://github.com/OMGtechy/swimps/issues).

## Financially

This project wasn't started for money ... but if it means that much to you, it's much appreciated. Who knows, maybe this could become a full-time job someday. You can contribute via [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/OMGtechy/donate) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=38788556).

## Spreading the word.

The more people that know about the project, the better. This leads to more people making all the other kinds of contributions and users reaping the project's benefits too!

# Who owns contributions?

By contributing to the project, you are allowing the project and its owner (Joshua Gerrard) to use the contribution as if it were their own. You maintain the right to use what you've contributed elsewhere, but the project and its owner gets those rights too. This is here to avoid future problems around changing licenses. It also means this project can be simpler; everything is under the same license.

# Can I take something back once I've contributed it?

No. It would be a legal minefield trying to work out what was derived from it and not.

# Who is responsible for making sure my contributions are legal?

You are. If you've been reading some copyrighted or copylefted material that isn't yours to contribute, don't contribute it. This project is supposed to be lovely and open source, let's not muddy that up with dubious intellectual property.

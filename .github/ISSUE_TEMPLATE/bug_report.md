**What you were doing**
Were you profiling something, building the code, seeing how high you could crank the sample rate ... ?

**What happened**
Did an error message appear? Were the results wrong? What didn't act as you expected?

**What you expected to happen**
No crash? Successful compilation? Some parameter to do something different?

**Reproduction steps**
For example:
1) Compile program X with compiler Y with the --oh-no flag.
2) Run swimps with --samples-per-second -1
3) Notice velociraptors appearing on screen.

**Environment**
- OS (including version):
- Architecture (x86_64, aarch64, ...):
- swimps version:
- Dump of environment variables (if possible):

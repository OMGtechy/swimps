**What you want to do**
Were you profiling something, building the code, seeing how high you could crank the sample rate ... ?

**How you can currently achieve it**
Can you do what you want without this feature? Is it a convoluted process? Is it just not possible without a new feature?

**What you would like instead**
A cool new function / class? A guide on how to do it on your own?

**An example workflow**
For example:
1) Run swimps --amazing-flag
2) Hear strange noise getting closer.
3) Notice velociraptors appearing on screen.

**Desired platform**
- OS (including version):
- Architecture (x86_64, aarch64, ...):

**Extra info**
Anything else you'd like to add?

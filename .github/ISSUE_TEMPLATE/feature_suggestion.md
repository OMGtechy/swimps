**What you want to do**
Were you profiling something, building the code, seeing how high you could crank the sample rate ... ?

**How you can currently achieve it**
Did an error message appear? Were the results wrong? What didn't act as you expected?

**What you would like instead**
No crash? Successfuly compilation? Some parameter to do something different?

**An example workflow**
For example:
1) Run swimps --amazing-flag
2) Hear strange noise getting closer.
3) Notice velociraptors appearing on screen.

**Desired platform**
- OS (including version):
- Architecture (x86_64, aarch64, ...):

**Extra info**
Anything else you'd like to add?

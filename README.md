# swimps
Helps you work out where your code is spending its time (a.k.a. a profiler).

A prior project, [wimps (why is my program slow)](https://github.com/OMGtechy/wimps), did this too. However, [wimps](https://github.com/OMGtechy/wimps) was more an educational tool to help people understand how sampling profilers might work. This is a more serious attempt at making a useful profiler, hence its name, swimps (serious [wimps](https://github.com/OMGtechy/wimps)).
